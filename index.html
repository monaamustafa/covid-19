                        <span> COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                        It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mainP">Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of
                        breath
                        and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>
                    <p class="mainP">
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth
                        and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact

                                <p> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals
                                    and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19
                                    is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.</p>

                                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a
                                    nation.
                                    Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                                    blame
                                    someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                                    80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                                    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
                                    breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood
                                    pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                                    People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and

                                    about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards

                                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a

                                    Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                                    blame
                                    someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                                    Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead
