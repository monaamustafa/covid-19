                <h3>CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h3>
                <p>
                    <span> COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                    It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                    China.
                    <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath
                        and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>
                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth
                        and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                        with
                        anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                    There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to
                    prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Stay aware of the latest information on the
                    COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health
                    authority.

                    To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
                    However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
                    be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.

                <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms
                    while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until
                    you have recovered.
